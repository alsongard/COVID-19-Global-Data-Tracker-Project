| `tests_units`                     | Units used by the location to report its testing data. A country file can't contain mixed units. All metrics concerning testing data use the specified test unit. Valid units are 'people tested' (number of people tested), 'tests performed' (number of tests performed. a single person can be tested more than once in a given day) and 'samples tested' (number of samples tested.
