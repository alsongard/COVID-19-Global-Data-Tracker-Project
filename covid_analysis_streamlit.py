| `new_tests_smoothed`              | New tests for COVID-19 (7-day smoothed). For countries that don't report testing data on a daily basis, we assume that testing changed equally on a daily basis over any periods in which no data was reported. This produces a complete series of daily figures, which is then averaged over a rolling 7-day window                                                                                                                                                  |

| `tests_units`                     | Units used by the location to report its testing data. A country file can't contain mixed units. All metrics concerning testing data use the specified test unit. Valid units are 'people tested' (number of people tested), 'tests performed' (number of tests performed. a single person can be tested more than once in a given day) and 'samples tested' (number of samples tested. In some cases, more than one sample may be required to perform a given test.) |
